# Algorithm_trading_bot

This is a project coded in Node.js.

I am interested in cryptocurrency,
so I learn some trading algorithms on the internet and learn node.js from online materials,
and then create this algorithm trade bot and auto trading cryptocurrency by connects to binance API.

Because I had built my own NAS, so this is currently run in a VM in the NAS.
